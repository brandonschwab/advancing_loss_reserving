## Advancing Loss Reserving: A Hybrid Neural Network Approach for Individual Claim Development Prediction

This project contains the material for the application of the individual loss reserving model described in: Advancing Loss Reserving: A Hybrid Neural Network Approach for Individual Claim Development Prediction.

## Abstract

The accurate estimation of loss reserves is critical for the financial health of insurance companies and informs numerous operational decisions, from pricing to strategic planning. We add to the literature by a proposing a novel neural network architecture that enhances the prediction of incurred loss amounts for reported but not settled (RBNS) claims. Moreover, in contrast to most other studies, we test our model on  proprietary data sets from a large industrial insurer. Our analyses reveal the model's superiority in estimating reserves more accurately across different lines of business than standard benchmark models, like the chain ladder approach. Particularly, it exhibits nuanced performance at the branch level, reflecting its capacity to integrate individual claim characteristics effectively. Our findings underscore the potential of machine learning in enhancing actuarial forecasting and suggest a shift towards more granular data applications in the insurance industry.
